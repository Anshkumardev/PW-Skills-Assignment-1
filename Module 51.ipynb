    "Overfitting occurs when a model learns the details and noise in the training data to an extent that it negatively impacts the performance of the model on new data. This means the model is too complex, with too many parameters relative to the number of observations. Consequences include poor prediction performance and generalization on unseen data. Mitigation strategies include simplifying the model, using regularization techniques, and increasing training data.\n",

    "Underfitting happens when a model is too simple to learn the underlying pattern of the data and thus performs poorly even on training data. This is often due to a model that is not complex enough. Consequences include inability to capture trends in the data, leading to low accuracy on both training and new data. Mitigation strategies involve increasing model complexity, adding more features, or using more sophisticated models."
