    "MUltithreading is a process where tasks can be assigned as threads and can be processed under single core. Multiple threads can be created for different operations and can be runned one after another. This helps to maintane processing time. It is mainly used to perform taks concurrently or simultaneously. It improves the performance of any program as it utilize multicore functionality and improves the response of the program. "
